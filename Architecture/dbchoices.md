Absolutely! Here's a quick breakdown of popular databases categorized by their **replication model**:

---

## üìå 1. **Single-Leader Replication**

Only one node handles **writes**; others are read replicas.

### ‚úÖ Example Databases:

| Database                  | Notes                                         |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **MySQL**                 | Very common; default single-leader model      |
| **PostgreSQL**            | Primary-replica setup is single-leader        |
| **MongoDB** (Replica Set) | Primary handles writes, secondaries for reads |
| **HBase**                 | Uses single RegionServer as leader per region |
| **Oracle**                | Enterprise-grade single-leader replication    |

---

## üìå 2. **Multi-Leader Replication**

Multiple nodes can accept **writes**, which are replicated to others.

### ‚úÖ Example Databases:

| Database                            | Notes                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **CouchDB**                         | Built-in multi-master; uses conflict resolution |
| **Cassandra**                       | Can be configured for multi-leader-like writes  |
| **Active-Active Redis** (with CRDB) | Replicates across regions                       |
| **Firebase Realtime DB**            | Peer-to-peer replication under the hood         |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Multi-leader systems often require **conflict resolution** strategies like **timestamps**, **version vectors**, or **CRDTs**.

---

## üìå 3. **Leaderless / Eventual Consistency**

No designated leader. All nodes can serve reads/writes. Conflict resolution is handled eventually.

### ‚úÖ Example Databases:

| Database            | Notes                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Amazon DynamoDB** | Core of Dynamo-style, leaderless consistency       |
| **Cassandra**       | Eventually consistent writes + tunable consistency |
| **Riak**            | Based on Dynamo model; supports CRDTs              |
| **SimpleDB**        | Lightweight, eventually consistent                 |

## üß† Summary Table

| Replication Model | Example Databases                             | Use When...                                                  |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Single-leader** | MySQL, Postgres, HBase, MongoDB (replica set) | You need strict ordering & easy consistency                  |
| **Multi-leader**  | CouchDB, Cassandra (some configs), Redis CRDB | You want high availability & write-flexibility               |
| **Leaderless**    | DynamoDB, Riak, Cassandra (EC mode)           | You want max availability & can tolerate conflict resolution |
