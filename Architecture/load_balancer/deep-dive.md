# Load Balancer Deep Dive

## Overview

A **load balancer** distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to enhance system availability, performance, and scalability. It acts as a reverse proxy to distribute application or network traffic.

## Why Use a Load Balancer?

- **High Availability**: Automatically redirects traffic if a server goes down.
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduces latency by routing to optimal servers.
- **Scalability**: Supports horizontal scaling.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Maintains service continuity even during server failures.
- **Security**: Offloads SSL, enforces rate limiting, and integrates with WAFs.

## Load Balancing Layers

### Layer 4 (Transport Layer)

- Routes based on IP and TCP/UDP port.
- No content inspection.
- Example: AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB), HAProxy (L4).

### Layer 7 (Application Layer)

- Routes based on content, headers, cookies, paths.
- Supports advanced features: SSL termination, URL-based routing.
- Example: AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB), Nginx, Traefik.

| Feature                  | Layer 4                      | Layer 7                          |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Speed                    | High                         | Moderate                         |
| Routing Intelligence     | Low                          | High                             |
| Protocol Support         | TCP/UDP                      | HTTP/HTTPS                       |
| Use Cases                | DBs, low-latency services    | Web apps, APIs, microservices    |

## Load Balancing Strategies

- **Round Robin**: Distributes requests in order. Simple, best for similar servers.
- **Least Connections**: Routes to server with fewest active sessions.
- **Weighted**: Prioritizes based on server capacity (e.g., Weighted Round Robin).
- **IP Hash**: Sticky session strategy using client IP.

## Software vs Hardware Load Balancers

| Feature         | Software                        | Hardware                          |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Cost            | Low (Open-source)               | High                              |
| Flexibility     | High                            | Low                               |
| Scalability     | Dynamic                         | Limited                           |
| Examples        | Nginx, HAProxy, Envoy           | F5 Big-IP, Cisco ACE              |
| Deployment      | VMs, containers                 | On-premises appliance             |

## Key Design Patterns

- **Redundancy**: Active-active or active-passive load balancers.
- **Auto-scaling**: Integrates with cloud platforms.
- **Geo Load Balancing**: Uses Anycast or GeoDNS for regional routing.
- **Session Persistence**: Maintains sticky sessions when needed.

## Load Balancer vs API Gateway

| Feature               | Load Balancer                          | API Gateway                         |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Purpose                | Distribute traffic among services      | Manage, secure, and orchestrate APIs|
| Layer Focus            | Primarily Layer 4/7                   | Application layer (Layer 7)         |
| Functionality          | Routing, health checks, SSL termination| Rate limiting, auth, transformation |
| Protocols              | TCP/UDP/HTTP/HTTPS                    | HTTP/HTTPS                          |
| Examples               | Nginx, ALB, Envoy, HAProxy             | Kong, Apigee, AWS API Gateway       |
| Developer Experience   | Low-level traffic routing             | Rich API management tooling         |
| Use Cases              | Horizontal scaling of services        | Microservices API control           |

## Conclusion

Load balancers are critical to building robust, scalable, and performant systems. Choosing the right type and strategy depends on application architecture, workload patterns, and traffic behavior. For API-heavy architectures, consider combining a load balancer with an API gateway for maximum control and resilience.
